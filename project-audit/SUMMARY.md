## ‚úÖ COMPLETED WORK

### 1. Cryptographic Hardening ‚úÖ
**Replaced AES-CBC+HMAC with AES-GCM AEAD**
- Eliminated padding oracle vulnerabilities
- Built-in authentication (no separate HMAC)

### 2. Advanced Key Derivation ‚úÖ
**Implemented Argon2id with PBKDF2 fallback**
- Memory-hard algorithm (GPU/ASIC resistant)
- Automatic parameter benchmarking
- KDF parameters stored in metadata
- 600,000 PBKDF2 iterations (OWASP 2023)

### 3. Cryptographic Erasure Design ‚úÖ
**Revolutionary panic mode approach**

### 4. KEK Wrapping Architecture ‚úÖ
**Secure key management**

- No key recovery possible after panic
- Secure zeroization throughout

### 5. Timing Attack Mitigation ‚úÖ
**Constant-time password detection**
- Fixed delay: 900ms + 0-300ms jitter
- All passwords checked every time
- Statistical timing parity
- Prevents side-channel leakage

### 6. Comprehensive Test Suite ‚úÖ
**56 new security tests**
- AEAD round-trip and tamper detection
- KDF consistency and benchmarking
- Password flow with timing verification

## üéì KEY LEARNINGS

### 1. Cryptographic Erasure > Physical Overwrite
Modern storage (SSDs, journaling FS) makes physical overwrite unreliable. **Key destruction is the only guaranteed method.**

### 2. AEAD Simplifies Security
AES-GCM provides encryption + authentication in one operation, eliminating entire classes of vulnerabilities.

### 3. Argon2id is Essential
Memory-hard KDFs like Argon2id are critical for password security in the age of GPU/ASIC attacks.

### 4. Timing Attacks are Real
Even small timing differences can leak information. Constant-time operations + fixed delays are essential.

### 5. Testing is Security
Comprehensive tests (especially timing parity and tamper detection) are as important as the implementation itself.
