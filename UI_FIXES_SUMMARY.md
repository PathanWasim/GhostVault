# GhostVault UI Fixes Summary

## Date: October 3, 2025

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ‚úÖ Password Validation - All 3 Passwords Must Be Different
**Problem:** Passwords could be the same
**Solution:** Added validation in `InitialSetupController.validatePasswords()`:
```java
if (master.equals(panic) || master.equals(decoy) || panic.equals(decoy)) {
    statusLabel.setText("All passwords must be different from each other.");
    return false;
}
```

### 2. ‚úÖ Navigation After Vault Creation
**Problem:** After creating vault, app just showed Exit and Help buttons without redirecting
**Solution:** 
- Added `passwordManager.initializePasswords()` call to actually create the vault
- Added automatic navigation to login screen after 1.5 seconds
- Added `showLoginScene()` method to UIManager
- Updated ApplicationIntegrator to pass PasswordManager to InitialSetupController

**Code Changes:**
- `InitialSetupController.handleCreateVault()` - Now creates vault and navigates
- `UIManager.showLoginScene()` - New method to navigate to login
- `UIManager.createFirstRunSetupScene()` - Now accepts PasswordManager parameter
- `ApplicationIntegrator.showFirstRunSetup()` - Passes PasswordManager to UI

### 3. ‚úÖ UI Layout - Professional Design Without Scrolling
**Problem:** UI required scrolling, looked unprofessional
**Solution:** Complete UI redesign

#### FXML Changes (`initial_setup.fxml`):
- Changed from ScrollPane to BorderPane layout
- Organized into 3 sections: Header, Center, Footer
- Reduced spacing and padding for better fit
- Made password fields larger (40px height)
