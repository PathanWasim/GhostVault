# GhostVault - Fixes Applied

## ‚úÖ What Was Fixed

### 1. File List Not Showing Uploaded Files
**Problem:** Files were being uploaded but not appearing in the list  
**Root Cause:** `refreshFileList()` had a TODO and was showing placeholder files  
**Fix:** Implemented actual file loading from `.ghostvault/files` directory  
**Result:** Uploaded files now appear in the list immediately

### 2. Cleaned Up Documentation
**Problem:** Too many confusing MD files  
**Fix:** Deleted unnecessary documentation files:
- IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md
- COMPLETION_REPORT.md
- BUG_FIXES.md
- FEATURE_IMPLEMENTATION.md
- PROJECT_STATUS.md
- CURRENT_STATUS.md
- IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md

### 3. Updated .gitignore
**Added:**
- `.kiro/` - Kiro IDE files
- `project-audit/` - Audit files
- All unnecessary MD documentation files

## üéØ What's Working Now

### File Operations
- ‚úÖ **Upload:** Opens FileChooser, encrypts files, stores them, refreshes list
- ‚úÖ **Download:** Opens save dialog, decrypts files
- ‚úÖ **Delete:** Confirms, securely deletes files
- ‚úÖ **Backup:** Creates encrypted .gvb backups
- ‚úÖ **Restore:** Restores from backup files

### Mode-Specific Behavior
- ‚úÖ **Master Password:** Full vault with real file operations
- ‚úÖ **Panic Password:** Immediate wipe, no interface shown
- ‚úÖ **Decoy Password:** Fake vault with harmless decoy files

### UI Theme
- ‚úÖ **Dark Theme:** Professional colors, loaded by default
- ‚úÖ **Color-Coded Buttons:** Blue/Green/Red/Orange/Purple
- ‚úÖ **Animations:** Hover effects, transitions, shadows
