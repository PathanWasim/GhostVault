# Requirements Document

## Introduction

GhostVault is an offline, highly secure file vault application built in Java using Maven. The application provides seamless encryption, decryption, secure deletion, and audit logging functionalities while ensuring that security features, especially panic mode, remain discreet and unexposed to potential attackers. The application features a polished, professional interface with intuitive UI and robust backend logic, handling all sensitive operations in a way that protects user data even under duress or physical observation.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a security-conscious user, I want a single password field that can trigger different behaviors based on the password entered, so that I can maintain operational security under various threat scenarios.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application launches THEN the system SHALL display a single password input field
2. WHEN the master password is entered THEN the system SHALL provide normal vault access with full functionality
3. WHEN the panic password is entered THEN the system SHALL trigger immediate secure destruction without revealing panic mode activation
4. WHEN the decoy password is entered THEN the system SHALL open a fake vault containing harmless files
5. WHEN an invalid password is entered THEN the system SHALL display a generic error message without revealing which type of password was attempted

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a new user, I want an initial setup screen to configure all necessary passwords securely, so that I can establish proper security measures from the start.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is launched for the first time THEN the system SHALL display an initial setup screen
2. WHEN setting up passwords THEN the system SHALL require configuration of master, panic, and decoy passwords
3. WHEN passwords are entered THEN the system SHALL provide real-time password strength feedback
4. WHEN passwords are stored THEN the system SHALL hash and encrypt them using secure methods
5. WHEN setup is complete THEN the system SHALL securely store all password hashes and transition to normal operation
6. IF password recovery is implemented THEN the system SHALL provide secure recovery options that maintain offline operation

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user storing sensitive files, I want robust file encryption and storage capabilities, so that my data remains protected even if the storage medium is compromised.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN files are stored THEN the system SHALL encrypt each file individually using AES-256
2. WHEN files are encrypted THEN the system SHALL use CBC mode with random IV for each file
3. WHEN metadata is stored THEN the system SHALL encrypt file names, sizes, hashes, and other metadata
4. WHEN the vault is created THEN the system SHALL establish a directory structure with separate areas for files, decoys, metadata, salt, and audit logs
5. WHEN keys are derived THEN the system SHALL use PBKDF2WithHmacSHA256 with securely generated salt
6. WHEN file integrity is verified THEN the system SHALL use SHA-256 hashes for integrity checks

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user under duress, I want a panic mode that can be triggered discreetly, so that I can protect my data without alerting potential attackers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the panic password is entered THEN the system SHALL initiate secure wipe of all files, logs, metadata, and sensitive data
2. WHEN panic mode is activated THEN the system SHALL operate silently without UI warnings or confirmation prompts
3. WHEN secure deletion occurs THEN the system SHALL perform multiple overwrite passes on all sensitive data
4. WHEN panic mode completes THEN the system SHALL not provide any indication that panic mode was activated
5. WHEN panic wipe is in progress THEN the system SHALL appear to function normally to external observers

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user who may be coerced into opening my vault, I want a decoy mode that presents fake but realistic content, so that I can mislead attackers while protecting my real data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the decoy password is entered THEN the system SHALL open a fake vault interface
2. WHEN decoy mode is active THEN the system SHALL display pre-generated harmless files
3. WHEN decoy files are presented THEN the system SHALL ensure they appear realistic but contain no connection to real data
4. WHEN decoy mode is used THEN the system SHALL provide the same interface functionality as normal mode
5. WHEN decoy files are accessed THEN the system SHALL allow normal file operations on the fake content

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user managing encrypted files, I want comprehensive file management capabilities, so that I can efficiently organize and access my secure data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN uploading files THEN the system SHALL encrypt and store them in the vault
2. WHEN downloading files THEN the system SHALL decrypt and provide access to the original content
3. WHEN deleting files THEN the system SHALL perform secure deletion with multiple overwrite passes
4. WHEN browsing files THEN the system SHALL display file names, sizes, and last-modified dates
5. WHEN searching files THEN the system SHALL provide search functionality by file name
6. WHEN file operations fail THEN the system SHALL provide proper error handling without exposing technical details

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user who values aesthetics and usability, I want a polished and intuitive interface, so that I can efficiently use the application without compromising security.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is displayed THEN the system SHALL provide a clean, intuitive interface with polished appearance
2. WHEN themes are selected THEN the system SHALL support both dark and light themes
3. WHEN file operations are performed THEN the system SHALL provide responsive UI feedback for encryption, decryption, and deletion
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL display clear messages without exposing unnecessary technical details
5. WHEN state transitions occur THEN the system SHALL provide smooth transitions between login, vault view, and other states

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user who needs data portability, I want secure backup and restore capabilities, so that I can safely transfer or recover my vault data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN exporting vault data THEN the system SHALL maintain encryption during the export process
2. WHEN importing vault data THEN the system SHALL securely restore encrypted backup files
3. WHEN backup operations fail THEN the system SHALL handle partial restores and corrupted backups gracefully
4. WHEN backup files are created THEN the system SHALL ensure they remain encrypted and secure
5. WHEN restore operations complete THEN the system SHALL verify data integrity and completeness

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a security-conscious user, I want session management and duress detection capabilities, so that my vault remains secure even if I'm away or under threat.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user is inactive THEN the system SHALL automatically logout after a configurable time period
2. WHEN logout is imminent THEN the system SHALL warn users without exposing the specific reason
3. WHEN failed login attempts occur THEN the system SHALL track suspicious behavior patterns
4. WHEN duress indicators are detected THEN the system SHALL trigger appropriate protection measures
5. WHEN sessions end THEN the system SHALL securely clear all sensitive data from memory

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a user who needs accountability, I want comprehensive audit logging, so that I can track all operations performed on my vault while maintaining security.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN vault operations occur THEN the system SHALL log all activities with timestamps
2. WHEN audit logs are stored THEN the system SHALL encrypt them and make them append-only
3. WHEN audit logs are reviewed THEN the system SHALL provide masked content to protect sensitive information
4. WHEN logging sensitive operations THEN the system SHALL ensure logs don't expose critical security details
5. WHEN audit trails are maintained THEN the system SHALL ensure they survive normal operations but are destroyed during panic mode
