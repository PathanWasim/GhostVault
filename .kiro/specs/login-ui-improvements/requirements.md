# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This spec addresses critical user experience issues with the GhostVault login interface. Currently, users are experiencing two major problems: (1) the login process gets stuck after entering a password and clicking the "Access Vault" button, failing to navigate to the vault interface, and (2) the button displays an unprofessional rotating/spinning animation during authentication. These issues severely impact the application's usability and professional appearance, preventing users from accessing their secure vault even with correct credentials.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Login Navigation Flow

**User Story:** As a GhostVault user, I want the login process to successfully navigate me to the vault interface after entering my password, so that I can access my encrypted files without getting stuck on the login screen.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user enters a valid master password and clicks "Access Vault" THEN the system SHALL authenticate the password and navigate to the master vault interface within 2 seconds
2. WHEN a user enters a valid decoy password and clicks "Access Vault" THEN the system SHALL authenticate the password and navigate to the decoy vault interface within 2 seconds
3. WHEN authentication is in progress THEN the system SHALL display a clear status message indicating "Authenticating..." without blocking the UI thread
4. WHEN authentication completes successfully THEN the system SHALL display a success message (e.g., "Access granted!") before transitioning to the vault interface
5. WHEN authentication fails due to incorrect password THEN the system SHALL display an error message and reset the login form to allow retry
6. IF the vault interface fails to load THEN the system SHALL display an error message and return the user to the login screen with appropriate error details

### Requirement 2: Professional Button Animations

**User Story:** As a GhostVault user, I want the login button to have professional, subtle animations that provide visual feedback, so that the application feels polished and trustworthy rather than amateurish.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the "Access Vault" button is in its default state THEN it SHALL display with a professional gradient background and subtle shadow effect
2. WHEN a user hovers over the "Access Vault" button THEN it SHALL display a smooth scale animation (maximum 1.05x) and enhanced shadow without any rotation
3. WHEN a user clicks the "Access Vault" button THEN it SHALL display a subtle press effect (translate down 1-2px) without any spinning or rotating animation
4. WHEN authentication is in progress THEN the button SHALL be disabled with reduced opacity (0.6-0.8) and NO rotating, spinning, or continuous animation effects
5. WHEN the button is disabled THEN it SHALL maintain its position and scale without any movement animations
6. IF the user has accessibility preferences for reduced motion THEN the system SHALL minimize or eliminate all button animations

### Requirement 3: Asynchronous Authentication

**User Story:** As a GhostVault user, I want the authentication process to run in the background without freezing the UI, so that I can see status updates and the application remains responsive.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN authentication begins THEN the system SHALL execute the authentication logic on a background thread separate from the JavaFX Application Thread
2. WHEN authentication is running THEN the UI SHALL remain responsive and display animated status indicators
3. WHEN authentication completes THEN the system SHALL use Platform.runLater() to update UI components on the JavaFX Application Thread
4. IF authentication takes longer than 5 seconds THEN the system SHALL display a warning message indicating potential issues
5. WHEN the password field is cleared THEN it SHALL happen immediately upon clicking "Access Vault" for security purposes before authentication begins

### Requirement 4: Error Handling and Recovery

**User Story:** As a GhostVault user, I want clear error messages and automatic form recovery when authentication fails, so that I can quickly retry without confusion or manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL display a specific error message indicating the reason (e.g., "Invalid password", "Authentication timeout", "Vault initialization failed")
2. WHEN an error occurs THEN the system SHALL automatically re-enable the login button and password field within 500ms
3. WHEN the form is reset after an error THEN the system SHALL automatically focus the password field for immediate retry
4. IF a critical error occurs during vault loading THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information to the console for debugging
5. WHEN returning to the login screen after an error THEN the system SHALL clear any previous status messages

### Requirement 5: Visual Feedback and Status Messages

**User Story:** As a GhostVault user, I want clear visual feedback throughout the authentication process, so that I understand what the system is doing and whether my action was successful.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN authentication begins THEN the system SHALL display "üîê Authenticating..." in blue (#2196F3) with bold font weight
2. WHEN authentication succeeds THEN the system SHALL display "‚úì Access granted!" in green (#4CAF50) with bold font weight for at least 300ms before navigation
3. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL display the error message in red (#F44336) with bold font weight
4. WHEN the password field is empty and user clicks "Access Vault" THEN the system SHALL display "Please enter a password." in red
5. IF the application is not properly initialized THEN the system SHALL display "Application not properly initialized." in red

## Success Metrics

- Login success rate: 100% for valid credentials
- Authentication response time: < 2 seconds for typical passwords
- UI responsiveness: No UI freezing during authentication
- Error recovery time: < 500ms to reset form after error
- User satisfaction: Professional appearance with smooth animations
