# GhostVault Testing Framework

This document describes the comprehensive testing framework for GhostVault, including how to run tests and interpret results.

## Overview

The GhostVault testing framework consists of four main components:

1. **Unit Tests** - Test individual components and functions
2. **Integration Tests** - Test component interactions and end-to-end workflows
3. **Security Validation** - Comprehensive security testing and vulnerability assessment
4. **Performance Testing** - Performance benchmarking and optimization validation

## Quick Start

### Windows
```batch
run-tests.bat
```

### Linux/macOS
```bash
./run-tests.sh
```

### Manual Execution
```bash
# Compile the project
javac -d build/classes/main -cp ".:src/main/java:src/test/java" src/main/java/com/ghostvault/**/*.java
javac -d build/classes/test -cp ".:src/main/java:src/test/java:build/classes/main" src/test/java/com/ghostvault/**/*.java

# Run comprehensive tests
java -cp "build/classes/main:build/classes/test" com.ghostvault.ComprehensiveTestRunner
```

## Test Components

### 1. Main Test Suite (`TestSuite.java`)

The main test suite runs all basic functionality tests including:

- **Security Tests**
  - CryptoManager encryption/decryption
  - PasswordManager validation
  - PanicModeExecutor functionality
  - SessionManager timeout handling
  - Password strength validation

- **Core Tests**
  - FileManager file operations
  - VaultInitializer setup/teardown
  - DecoyManager decoy file creation
  - MetadataManager operations

- **UI Tests**
  - Password strength validation logic
  - File management operations

- **Integration Tests**
  - End-to-end vault operations
  - Cross-component communication
  - Security integration

- **Performance Tests**
  - Encryption performance
  - File operations performance
  - Memory usage validation

### 2. Security Validation Framework (`SecurityValidationFramework.java`)

Comprehensive security testing including:

- **Encryption Security**
  - AES-256-CBC strength validation
  - PBKDF2 key derivation security
  - Cryptographic randomness testing
  - Encryption key uniqueness

- **Authentication Security**
  - Password hashing security
  - Password strength enforcement
  - Timing attack resistance

- **Data Protection**
  - File integrity verification
  - Secure memory management
  - Secure file deletion

- **Session Security**
  - Session timeout protection
  - Failed login tracking
  - Duress detection

- **Emergency Features**
  - Panic mode data destruction
  - Emergency response time
  - Decoy mode functionality

### 3. Performance Test Framework (`PerformanceTestFramework.java`)

Performance benchmarking including:

- **Encryption Performance**
  - Small file encryption (1KB)
  - Medium file encryption (1MB)
  - Large file encryption (10MB)

- **Key Operations**
  - PBKDF2 key derivation timing
  - Password validation performance

- **File Operations**
  - File storage performance
  - File retrieval performance
  - Metadata operations speed

- **Bulk Operations**
  - Bulk file upload testing
  - Concurrent operation handling

- **System Performance**
  - Memory usage under load
  - Garbage collection impact
  - Application startup time

### 4. Comprehensive Test Runner (`ComprehensiveTestRunner.java`)

Orchestrates all test phases and provides:
- Sequential execution of all test suites
- Comprehensive reporting
- Pass/fail status for deployment readiness
- Detailed performance metrics

## Test Results Interpretation

### Success Indicators
- ✅ All tests pass
- 🛡️ Security validation complete
- 🚀 Performance benchmarks met
- 📊 Memory usage within limits

### Failure Indicators
- ❌ Failed tests require immediate attention
- 🚨 Security vulnerabilities must be fixed before deployment
- ⚠️ Performance issues may impact user experience

## Security Test Details

### Encryption Standards
- **Algorithm**: AES-256-CBC
- **Key Derivation**: PBKDF2 with SHA-256
- **IV Generation**: Cryptographically secure random
- **Salt Generation**: 32-byte random salt per password

### Security Validations
- Encryption produces different output for same input (IV randomness)
- Different salts produce different keys
- Key derivation is computationally expensive (>10ms)
- Timing attacks are mitigated through constant-time operations
- Memory is securely wiped after use
- File integrity is verified through checksums

## Performance Benchmarks

### Expected Performance Metrics
- **Small File Encryption**: >50 MB/s
- **Large File Encryption**: >20 MB/s
- **Key Derivation**: <500ms per operation
- **Password Validation**: <100ms per validation
- **File Storage**: >10 files/second
- **Memory Usage**: <100MB peak for standard operations

### Performance Optimization
- Bulk operations are optimized for throughput
- Memory usage is monitored and controlled
- Garbage collection impact is minimized
- Concurrent operations are thread-safe

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Compilation Errors**
   - Ensure Java 8+ is installed
   - Check JAVA_HOME environment variable
   - Verify all source files are present

2. **Test Failures**
   - Check vault directory permissions
   - Ensure no other processes are using test files
   - Verify system has sufficient memory

3. **Performance Issues**
   - Close other applications during testing
   - Ensure system is not under heavy load
   - Check available disk space

### Debug Mode
To run tests with detailed output:
```bash
java -Dcom.ghostvault.debug=true -cp "build/classes/main:build/classes/test" com.ghostvault.ComprehensiveTestRunner
```

## Continuous Integration

For CI/CD pipelines, use the exit codes:
- `0`: All tests passed
- `1`: One or more tests failed

Example CI script:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
./run-tests.sh
if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
    echo "Tests passed - proceeding with deployment"
else
    echo "Tests failed - blocking deployment"
    exit 1
fi
```
