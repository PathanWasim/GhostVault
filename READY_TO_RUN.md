## How to Run the Application

### Method 1: Using Maven (Recommended)
```bash
mvn javafx:run
```

### Method 2: Using the Batch File
```bash
RUN_APP.bat
```

This batch file will try multiple methods automatically.

### Method 3: Direct JAR Execution
```bash
# First build if not already built
mvn clean install "-Dmaven.test.skip=true"

# Then run
java -jar target/ghostvault-1.0.0.jar
```

## What to Expect

### 1. Initial Setup Screen
When you first run GhostVault, you'll see:

**Layout:**
- 🔐 Title at top: "GhostVault - Initial Setup"
- Instructions: "Create three unique passwords for maximum security"
- Three password sections (no scrolling needed):
  1. Master Password (Full vault access)
  2. Panic Password (Emergency data destruction)
  3. Decoy Password (Shows fake files)
- Each section has:
  - Password field (large, easy to use)
  - Strength meter (inline, color-coded)
  - Real-time feedback
- "Create Vault" button (large, blue, professional)
- Help and Exit buttons at bottom

**Features:**
- Real-time password strength checking
- Color-coded strength indicators (red → yellow → green)
- Hover effects on all buttons
- Professional gradient background
- Clean, modern design

### 2. Password Requirements
- **Master Password:** Must be very strong (4/5 or 5/5)
- **Panic Password:** Must be strong (3/5 or higher)
- **Decoy Password:** Must be strong (3/5 or higher)
- **All three MUST be different from each other**

### 3. After Creating Vault
1. Status shows: "Creating vault..."
2. Then: "✓ Vault created successfully! Redirecting to login..."
3. Automatically navigates to login screen after 1.5 seconds
4. You can now log in with your master password

### 4. Login Screen
After setup, you'll see the login screen where you can:
- Enter master password → Access real vault
- Enter panic password → Destroy all data (emergency)
- Enter decoy password → Show fake files

## Testing Checklist

When you run the app, verify:

- [ ] Initial setup screen appears
- [ ] All 3 password fields are visible without scrolling
- [ ] Password strength meters work in real-time
- [ ] Trying to use same password shows error: "All passwords must be different from each other"
- [ ] Using weak passwords shows appropriate error
- [ ] "Create Vault" button is clickable
- [ ] After clicking, status shows "Creating vault..."
- [ ] Success message appears
- [ ] Automatically redirects to login screen
- [ ] Login screen appears after 1.5 seconds

## Troubleshooting

### If you see "JavaFX runtime components are missing"
This means the JAR isn't running properly. Use Maven instead:
```bash
mvn javafx:run
```

### If Maven command fails
Make sure you're in the project directory:
```bash
cd "E:\Major Projects\CS Project\ghostvault"
mvn javafx:run
```

### If nothing happens
Check the console for error messages. Common issues:
1. Java version (need Java 17+)
2. Maven not installed
3. Port already in use

### If UI looks wrong
The CSS should be automatically applied. If not:
- Check that `src/main/resources/styles/setup.css` exists
- Rebuild: `mvn clean install "-Dmaven.test.skip=true"`
