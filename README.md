## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Java 11 or higher
- JavaFX 11 or higher (included in most Java distributions)

### Installation
1. Download the latest release from the releases page
2. Extract the archive to your desired location
3. Run the application:
   ```bash
   java -jar ghostvault.jar
   ```

### First Run Setup
1. Launch GhostVault
2. Create three strong passwords:
   - **Master Password**: Your main vault access
   - **Panic Password**: Emergency destruction trigger
   - **Decoy Password**: Fake vault access
3. All passwords must be different and meet strength requirements
4. Your vault is now ready to use!

## üìñ Usage Guide

### Basic Operations

3. Choose where to save the decrypted file
4. File integrity is automatically verified

#### Secure Deletion
1. Select a file from the vault list
2. Click the "üóëÔ∏è Delete" button
3. Confirm deletion in the dialog
4. File is securely overwritten multiple times

#### Searching Files
- Use the search box to find files by name
- Results update in real-time as you type
- Search works on original file names

### Advanced Features

#### Creating Backups
1. Click the "üì¶ Backup" button
2. Choose a secure location for the backup file

4. Backup file (.gvbackup) is created with full encryption

#### Restoring from Backup
1. Click the "üì• Restore" button
2. Select your .gvbackup file
3. Enter your master password
4. Choose merge or replace option

#### Security Modes

**Panic Mode**
- Enter your panic password at login
- Silently destroys all vault data
- Appears as normal failed login
- Cannot be undone - use with extreme caution

**Decoy Mode**
- Enter your decoy password at login
- Shows fake files to mislead attackers
- Completely separate from real vault
- Maintains plausible deniability

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Architecture

### Encryption Details
- **Algorithm**: AES-256-CBC with PKCS5 padding
- **Key Derivation**: PBKDF2WithHmacSHA256 (100,000+ iterations)
- **IV Generation**: Cryptographically secure random
- **File Integrity**: SHA-256 hash verification
- **Metadata Protection**: Encrypted separately from file data

### Password Security
- Passwords stored as salted hashes only
- Memory wiping after password operations
- Strong password requirements enforced
- Protection against timing attacks

### File Storage
- Files stored with random UUID names
- Original names encrypted in metadata
- Flat storage structure (no directory preservation)
- Secure deletion with multiple overwrites

### Session Security
- Configurable session timeout
- Activity monitoring (mouse/keyboard)
- Failed login attempt tracking
- Automatic lockout after max attempts

## üé® Themes and Accessibility

### Theme Support
- **Dark Theme** - Professional dark interface (default)
- **Light Theme** - Clean light interface
- **High Contrast** - Enhanced visibility for accessibility
- **Smooth Transitions** - Professional animations between themes

## üîí Security Considerations

### Best Practices
1. **Use Strong Passwords** - Follow the strength requirements
2. **Regular Backups** - Create encrypted backups frequently
3. **Secure Storage** - Store backups in multiple secure locations
4. **Password Management** - Never reuse vault passwords elsewhere
5. **Physical Security** - Secure your computer and backup media

### Threat Model
GhostVault protects against:
- **Data Theft** - Files encrypted with strong algorithms
- **Password Attacks** - Strong hashing with high iteration counts
- **Coercion** - Panic mode for emergency data destruction
- **Surveillance** - Decoy mode for plausible deniability
- **Forensic Analysis** - Secure deletion and encrypted metadata

### Limitations
- **Password Recovery** - Lost passwords cannot be recovered (by design)
- **Quantum Resistance** - AES-256 is currently quantum-resistant
- **Side-Channel Attacks** - Mitigated but not completely eliminated
- **Physical Access** - Cannot protect against hardware-level attacks
